= Spring-Boot-Angular-Template image:https://travis-ci.com/mrrobworks/spring-boot-angular-template.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.com/mrrobworks/spring-boot-angular-template"]

Template to create a OAuth2 secured dockerized Spring Boot Application with Angular Frontend.
A user with a Google- or Github-Account get access to the Application using OAuth2-Authentication, so
no additional User Registration is required. A new user get the Default-Role _ROLE_USER_. Additional Roles,
like _ROLE_ADMIN_ for administrative access, can be assigned to a user through the Role-Management.
The data get stored in a PostgreSQL database inside a Docker-Container.

Need to be installed on the OS to startup the application:

* :whale: https://www.docker.com/get-started[Docker]
* https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git]

Need to be installed on the OS for development purposes:

* :coffee:  https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html[JDK 11]
* https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven]
* :hot_pepper: https://projectlombok.org/download[Lombok]
* https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js]
* https://cli.angular.io/[Angular-CLI]

== Getting Started
To get the application running, some configuration need to be to do.

=== Prerequisites
*Step 1*: For executing commands we need a terminal. If you are running a bash-shell on a Linux-Distrubtion
or Mac-OS everything should be fine. The Windows _Powershell_ and _CMD_ could make some problems and
the build-process fails. My recommendation is to install the
https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/wsl/install-win10[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)]
in Windows 10 and using the bash-shell from it.

*Step 2:* Install  https://www.docker.com/get-started[Docker] and https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git] on your OS. This is
necessary to running the commands `git` and `docker-compose` in the terminal.

*Step 3:* Under the Docker-Settings, share the drive in which you will later git clone the
_spring-boot-angular-template.git_. This is necessary for accessing the sql-files for setting up the
database.

*Step 4:*
If you are running Windows 10 and using WSL with a terminal, then follow the instructions described in
this https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly[Blog-Post].

=== Google OAuth2

At first we need to register the application on Google to use their OAuth2-Authentication.

*Step 1:* Open a webbrowser and go to https://console.developers.google.com[https://console.developers.google.com]

*Step 2:* Press the Menu `Select a project` in the upper navigation-bar.

*Step 3:* Press the Menu-Item `New Project` and type in following:

*Step 4:* In the left sidemenu select `Credentials`

*Step 5:* Select `OAuth client ID`

image:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37511144/54868416-7ed29180-4d8c-11e9-9969-15f1a1f87d59.png[create credentials]

*Step 6:* Type in following:

*Step 7:* Copy your generated `client ID` and `client secret`

image:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37511144/54868470-13d58a80-4d8d-11e9-8b66-628f66cf5bee.png[oauth client]

=== Github OAuth2

Next we need to register the application on Github to use their OAuth2-Authentication.

*Step 1:* In your webbrowser go to https://github.com/settings/profile[https://github.com/settings/profile]

*Step 2:* Press on the left navigation side menu the Menu-Item `Developer-Settings`

*Step 3:* In the _Developer Settings_ dialog press the button `Register a new application`

image:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37511144/54868426-a9244f00-4d8c-11e9-81f8-5550819da14e.png[github-developer-settings]

*Step 4:* In the _Register a new OAuth application_ dialog type in following:

image:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37511144/54868432-bb9e8880-4d8c-11e9-926f-fbca57e7f8dd.png[github-register-oauth]

*Step 5:* Copy your generated `Client ID` and `Client Secret`

image:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37511144/54868423-97db4280-4d8c-11e9-9d96-2e760e716ddc.png[github-client-id-secret]

NOTE: Unfortunately github is not allowing adding more than one _Homepage URL_ and _Authorization callback URL_.
So for development purposes using the Google-OAuth2 should be prefered.

=== Installing

*Step 1:* Open a terminal and type:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mrrobworks/spring-boot-angular-template.git
$ cd spring-boot-angular-template
```

*Step 2:* Install the application with the command:
```bash
$ ./mvnw clean install \
-Dgoogle.client.id=[google-client-id] \
-Dgoogle.client.secret=[google-client-secret] \
-Dgithub.client.id=[github-client-id] \
-Dgithub.client.secret=[github-client-secret]
```

Replace `[google-client-id]`, `[google-client-secret]`, `[github-client-id]`, `[github-client-secret]` with your copied
values.

=== Run the application

Now you can simply run the application with following steps:

*Step 1:* In the project-root directory type following:
```bash
$  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ref.yml up
```

*Step 2:* In your Webbrowser type `http://localhost:8091` and the webapplication shows up.

=== Development

For Development some additional software need to be installed.

*Step 1:*  Install https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html[JDK 11],
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven] and https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js] on your OS.

*Step 2:* Open a terminal and type
```bash
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```
to install the https://cli.angular.io/[Angular-CLI]

*Step 3:* Open your IDE and install https://projectlombok.org/download[Lombok] as a Plugin.

To start the PostgreSQL database in a Docker-Container, open a terminal, change the location to
the project-root directory and type following:
```bash
$  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

If you develop with https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] there are also some
https://github.com/mrrobworks/spring-boot-angular-template/tree/master/.idea/runConfigurations[Run-Configurations]
in the Project-Repository. Start the Run-Configurations _docker-compose-DEV_, _backend-spring-boot-DEV_
and _frontend-angular-DEV_ in IntellJ and you are ready to go. Open a webbrowser, type `http://localhost:4200`
and the webapplication shows up.

=== Troubleshooting

*Trouble 1:* When installing the application with `./mvnw clean install` and you getting a error like this:
```
[ERROR] Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
[WARNING] An attempt failed, will retry 1 more times
org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoExecutionException: Could not build image
```
then restart the Docker deamon and the error should be gone.

*Trouble 2:* Using CMD or Powershell in Windows and install the application with `mvnw.cmd clean install` it
appears following:

```
[INFO] > cd bin && ng build --prod
[INFO]
[ERROR] 'ng' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
[ERROR] operable program or batch file.
```

This is usually a problem when installing the application with CMD or Powershell. The command `ng`
from the Angular-CLI is not recognized correctly. You need to install _Node.js_ and _Angular-CLI_
and then set the corresponding Windows-Evironment-Path variables. Also you can change in `frontend/package.json`
the following:

```
"scripts": {
    "ng": "ng",
    "start": "ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json",
    "build": "ng build --prod",
    "test": "ng test",
    "lint": "ng lint",
    "e2e": "ng e2e"
  }
```
